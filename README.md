In this repository there are two different ipyb notebooks. One is about application of Multivariate Denoising Autoencoders to MovieLens dataset as explained in here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05814.pdf

The other notebook is about application of Matrix Factorization techniques to the same dataset using Python Library, Recompy.

These notebooks are part of the lectures I have given at inzva Applied AI study group. Whole repository is here: https://github.com/inzva/Applied-AI-Study-Group-2020-June

Lectures are available on YouTube in Turkish. You can see them from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFpfol-jaZ0&list=PLhnxo6HZwBgnTokZUfwM-sM0-DXRyp-rl&index=38&ab_channel=inzvateam
